## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-run diagnostics file written alongside results

After each suite run, the test harness SHALL write a file
`reports/{runId}/diagnostics.json` containing one `WordDiagnostic` record per processed word.
The file SHALL be written atomically (all words) after the run completes, not streamed per-word.

#### Scenario: Diagnostics file created for every run
- **WHEN** a suite run completes (with or without matches)
- **THEN** `reports/{runId}/diagnostics.json` exists and contains one record per word

#### Scenario: No-match words have a diagnostics record
- **WHEN** `match()` returns null for a word
- **THEN** the diagnostics record for that word has `matched: false` and null/empty fields for
  match-specific data

### Requirement: WordDiagnostic record structure

Each `WordDiagnostic` record SHALL contain the following fields:

**Run context:**
- `word: string` — the word processed
- `generator: string` — effective generator used (`'anchor-pair' | 'single-sweep' | 'any-vertex'`)
- `scorer: string` — effective scorer used
- `matched: boolean`

**Phase counts (null when not matched):**
- `phase1Candidates: number | null` — candidates entering Phase 2
- `phase2Candidates: number | null` — candidates entering Phase 3
- `phase3Candidates: number | null` — candidates evaluated in Phase 3

**Winning placement (null when not matched):**
- `seedStarId: number | null`
- `seedRA: number | null`
- `seedDec: number | null`
- `physVerts: [number, number][] | null` — winning candidate physical vertex positions

**Star pool:**
- `nearbyStarCount: number | null` — size of nearby union set used for winning candidate

**Scores (null when not matched):**
- `shapeScore: number | null`
- `vertexFitScore: number | null`
- `procrustesScore: number | null`

**Per-vertex assignments (empty array when not matched):**
- `vertexAssignments: VertexAssignment[]`

Each `VertexAssignment` SHALL contain:
- `vertexIndex: number`
- `physVertRA: number` — ideal vertex position (RA, degrees)
- `physVertDec: number` — ideal vertex position (Dec, degrees)
- `assignedStarId: number`
- `assignedStarRA: number`
- `assignedStarDec: number`
- `distanceDeg: number` — haversine distance between assigned star and ideal vertex
- `distanceNormBySpan: number` — `distanceDeg / span` (span = max pairwise physVerts distance)

#### Scenario: Vertex assignment detail captured
- **WHEN** a match is found for `guitar` with 15 vertices
- **THEN** `vertexAssignments` contains exactly 15 entries, one per skeleton vertex

#### Scenario: Distances computed in degrees
- **WHEN** vertex 3 ideal position is (102.3°, 8.1°) and assigned star is at (102.5°, 8.0°)
- **THEN** `distanceDeg ≈ 0.22°` (haversine distance)

### Requirement: Matcher exposes per-phase counts for diagnostic capture

The `match()` function SHALL return phase candidate counts on `MatchResult` so the test harness
can record them without re-running the matcher:
- `phase1Candidates: number` — how many candidates entered Phase 2
- `phase2Candidates: number` — how many candidates entered Phase 3
- `phase3Candidates: number` — how many candidates were evaluated in Phase 3

These fields SHALL be added to `MatchResult` in `lambda/src/types.ts`.

#### Scenario: Phase counts in MatchResult
- **WHEN** a match is found
- **THEN** `result.phase1Candidates`, `result.phase2Candidates`, `result.phase3Candidates` are
  all non-negative integers

### Requirement: diagnostics.json does not block the run on failure

Writing `diagnostics.json` SHALL be best-effort. If the write fails (e.g. permissions error)
the harness SHALL log a warning and continue — the main results file and PNGs take priority.

#### Scenario: Write failure is non-fatal
- **WHEN** the diagnostics write throws an error
- **THEN** the run completes normally and results.json is still written
